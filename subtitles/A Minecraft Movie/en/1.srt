<i>(Fixed and synced manually)</i>

2
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:55,738
The Overworld,

3
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:59,000
the biggest sandbox in the universe,

4
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,750
is full of epic tales.

5
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,660
Millions and billions of them.

6
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,280
Well, guess what?

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,792
This one is all mine.

8
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,500
My name is Steve, and as a child,

9
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,959
I yearned for the mines!

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,640
But it didn't really work out.

11
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,500
Go on, get outta here!

12
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,167
So I did a terrible thing.

13
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,875
I grew up.
-Run!

14
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,750
And just as I expected,
it was a massive bummer.

15
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,375
Hey, Steve, your
presentation's in five minutes.

16
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,947
<i>Welcome to Steve's
Ultimate Resort Condominium</i>

17
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,870
<i>Ducks are in the lake and tennis in the back</i>

18
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,417
<i>Every room has jacuzzi and a mini-bar</i>

19
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,167
<i>Welcome to Steve's!</i>

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,542
<i>Woo! Welcome to Steve's!</i>

21
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,834
I really put myself out there,
and it totally blew up in my face.

22
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,084
It was the kind of life that made
a man stare into his potatoes.

23
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,584
And then I remembered!

24
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:30,792
I couldn't give up on my dream.

25
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,417
Not yet!

26
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,334
The mines!

27
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,750
So I bought a pickaxe,
and a sweet helmet,

28
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,584
and this time, I was unstoppable.

29
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,709
Head fake! Oh yeah!

30
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:03,584
Turns out my adventure was just beginning.

31
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,459
I mined my brains out.

32
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:09,875
Until I found two mysterious artifacts.

33
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,000
This thingy...

34
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:14,125
and that cool thingy.

35
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,250
And when I put those two thingies together...

36
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:20,610
you guessed it!

37
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,250
It opened a portal to another world.

38
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,417
The Overworld!

39
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:35,917
This place blew my mind.

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,910
I'd never seen anything like it.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,042
Woah!

42
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,334
Turns out it was the place
I'd been looking for my whole life!

43
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,030
A world where anything you can imagine,

44
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,667
you can create!

45
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,125
This is my first house...

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,917
My second house...

47
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,500
And my third house,
made entirely of sheep's wool.

48
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:06,834
Pink house!

49
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,125
Life was good.

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,417
The only thing missing...

51
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,375
was a friend to share it with.

52
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,500
And then this super angry wolf showed up.

53
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,542
Easy...

54
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,500
So I tamed him with a crusty femur bone.

55
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,167
Maybe a bone, huh? Yeah!

56
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,667
Atta boy!

57
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,500
Dennis!

58
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:31,250
He like a scratchy-scratch on the nariz.
That's a good boy, Dennis! Yeah!

59
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,125
With him by my side, my confidence soared.

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,000
Woohoo!

61
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,542
Together we built endless masterpieces.

62
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,292
The more I built, the better I got.

63
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,542
Dennis, check it out!

64
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>Welcome to Steve!</i>

65
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:56,750
<i>'Cause baby tonight, the creepers
trying to steal your stuff again</i>

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,750
Turns out pandas love to party.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,834
And cows!

68
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:06,375
<i>'Cause baby tonight, you grab your
pick, shovel and sword again</i>

69
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,667
<i>Again, again</i>

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,542
Life was perfect.

71
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:15,000
And the years simply flew by.

72
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,750
Until one day I came across
some strange ruins.

73
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,375
Flint and steel.

74
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,667
Woah!

75
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,125
Woohoo!

76
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,375
Dennis!

77
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,792
Turns out we just opened a portal
to a totally new dimension.

78
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,667
The Nether.

79
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:54,209
There was no joy or creativity at all.

80
00:05:59,084 --> 00:05:59,834
Dennis!

81
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,042
These piglin brutes
had mined this realm into oblivion.

82
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:09,334
Led by Malgosha, the evil piglin
sorceress who ruled the place.

83
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,334
Who are you, and why are you so round?

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,584
Leave the dog!

85
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,667
Take me instead!

86
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,385
No thanks. I'll take both of you!

87
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,584
And that orb.

88
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:21,375
Let's get one thing straight.

89
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:25,334
Where I come from, we call this a cube.

90
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,834
Seize them!

91
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,209
Malgosha had finally got
what she'd always wanted.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,125
The Orb of Dominance.

93
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,542
The most powerful cube-shaped orb
in the entire universe.

94
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,292
Listen up, you pigs!

95
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:42,584
With this orb, I will pillage the Overworld
and all of its gold will be ours!

96
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,947
I couldn't let this happen.

97
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,209
The Overworld had saved me,
and now I had to try to save it.

98
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,000
We have to stop her, Dennis.

99
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,500
So we escaped, and stole back the Orb!

100
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,530
The roundling has escaped!

101
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,917
Find him and bring me that orb!

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,334
Hurry, Dennis. Take this to Earth.

103
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,459
Follow my scent to 149 Holly Oak Drive.
You got that, boy?

104
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,125
Good boy. You're the
last hope for this world!

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,917
Now run! Go, boy!

106
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:14,750
Run, fluff-nugget!

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,875
You got this, Dennis! I love you!

108
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,500
Run!

109
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,875
Dennis was a hero that day.

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,917
He ran like the wind.

111
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,542
I didn't know if I'd ever see him again.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,792
But we had a world to save.

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,042
So he ran all the way back
to my house on Earth,

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,405
and hid the most powerful object in existence

115
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,334
under my waterbed.

116
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,238
As long as the Orb stays hidden,

117
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,584
the Overworld will be safe.

118
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:02,000
I just pray some doofus doesn't find it.

119
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,572
In the late 1980s,

120
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:39,375
Garrett Garrison took the
gaming world by storm,

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,030
becoming the undisputed champion
of the hit arcade game

122
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,250
Hunk City Rampage.

123
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:53,792
His mastery of this two-player co-op
shocked the world.

124
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,875
His effective use of the garbage toss move

125
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,542
earned him the nickname The Garbage Man.

126
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,655
He became the envy of the gaming world

127
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,625
after landing a lucrative
six-figure deal with Sizzler.

128
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,500
Yeah, baby!

129
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,959
One thing's for sure.

130
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,570
Yeah!
-This kid had it all.

131
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,500
Yeah!

132
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,167
Booyah!

133
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,167
Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garretson?

134
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,334
No autographs.

135
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,167
Have a nice day.

136
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,500
Woo! Yeah! Super cool!

137
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,959
Garrett the Garbage Man.

138
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,167
To what do we owe this pleasure?

139
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,084
Pleasure? You think I come
to storage auctions for fun?

140
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,334
I'm a businessman, Daryl. An investor.

141
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,542
Well, I'm about to shovel some coal
into your choo-choo train.

142
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,292
You're gonna love this next unit.

143
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,417
It's got a waterbed.

144
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,709
It's got some pickaxes.

145
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:47,250
It's got a huge can of mixed nuts.

146
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,584
It's got an array
of unisex turquoise blouses.

147
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,709
That sounds terrible.

148
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,125
I think it's also got a 1978 Atari Cosmos.

149
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:56,988
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

150
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,750
1978 Atari Cosmos?

151
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,834
That's what it says here.

152
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,459
Those things are worth a frickin' fortune.

153
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,625
Heck yeah, they are.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,947
Bro...

155
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:08,834
if you make this happen for me, I will
strongly consider hanging out with you.

156
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,667
You serious, bro?
-Yep.

157
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,363
Two big buffaloes like us out there,

158
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:19,167
in the wild, wearing
unisex turquoise blouses.

159
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,655
Oh boy, that's gonna cause a commotion.

160
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,697
The ladies aren't gonna know what to think.
-Listen, if you could keep the hammer price

161
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,709
under a hundy, I'll make all your
weird fanboy dreams come true.

162
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:29,125
Okay?

163
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:33,625
Two loose cannons, wearing turquoise blouses.

164
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,550
Yep. Let's do it.

165
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,322
And we got $500. $500 over here. We got $500.

166
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:41,459
We got six. Do we have six? Do we have $600?

167
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,363
We got $600 over here. Let me hear $700.

168
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:47,655
$700, we got $700 here,
we got $800 over here. We got...

169
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,209
$850, do I hear $850? Do we have...?
$850 over here! Do I hear any more?

170
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,655
Do I hear $900? $900.
$900 going once, $900 going twice,

171
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,488
and $900 going three times,
and sold! To hometown hero

172
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,709
Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison,
for $900.

173
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,334
I wouldn't cash that for about six months.

174
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,542
What?

175
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,875
Come to Papa. Cosmos.

176
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,959
Daryl! Where is it?

177
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,667
I'm sorry, I didn't check the box.

178
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,792
Woah, woah!
-Where's the Atari?

179
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,459
Woah!
-There's no Atari in here!

180
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,417
That does not mean you can trash this unit!

181
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,917
I'm up against it, man. I'm...

182
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,375
Oh, no. My store.

183
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,417
I just...

184
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,697
I need a win, man. I need...

185
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,250
I need a win.

186
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,875
Let's roll, everyone.

187
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,959
This man has no respect
for the storage community.

188
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,042
<i>Walkin' hand in hand</i>

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh no!

190
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,542
Look, Chuglass was not
my first choice either,

191
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,750
but it was Mom's dying wish
for us to live here.

192
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,370
Or at least that's how I interpreted it.

193
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,084
Yeah, I read something online.
This place sucks.

194
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,655
Anyways, rent is super low
and I've got a full-time gig here,

195
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,084
so it's not really an offer
we can turn down right now.

196
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,667
Yeah, I get it.

197
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,417
Look, I think you're
really gonna like it here.

198
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,584
Woah, what's going on with that dude?

199
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,625
Oh my gosh, Henry, we're in Chuglass!

200
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,375
Say hi to Chuggy the Chip.

201
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,542
Alright, this is the new neighborhood.

202
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,917
When was this house built?

203
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:18,292
It's so nice to meet you!

204
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,500
Yeah, nice to meet you.

205
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,667
Your new bosses sent you this.

206
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,250
Oh.

207
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:26,292
Yeah, people love working
at the potato chip factory.

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,340
Yeah, well, I'm running
their socials for a little bit.

209
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,625
I said I'd get their follower count past 75.

210
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:35,375
Nice! You must be Henry.
Nice to meet you, I'm Dawn.

211
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,167
Hi. Why is there an alpaca
hanging out of your car?

212
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,322
Well, real estate's not my only hustle.

213
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,875
I also do some mobile zoo stuff on the side.

214
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:47,125
Anywho, I gotta run.
Call me if you need anything.

215
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,697
Also, uh, I'm really sorry about your mom.

216
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,959
It's really brave what you're doing.
I hope you know that.

217
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,417
Thank you.

218
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,084
Henry! Breakfast is ready!

219
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:49,959
Coming!

220
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,000
Check it out.

221
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:58,072
I made you mom's signature
tater tot breakfast pizza,

222
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,459
so you can hand out slices on your first day.

223
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,375
I thought you wanted me to seem normal.

224
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,209
I do! Who do you think I am?

225
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,625
I got you some body spray.
Signature scents are huge here.

226
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,375
Velvet Mischief?

227
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,280
You're gonna want to spray it
and then walk into it.

228
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:15,167
Don't be too direct. It's really powerful.

229
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,167
Okay.
-Love you!

230
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,000
Love you too.

231
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,584
Smells like banana bread and poo.

232
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,709
Your store's really cool.

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,113
Yeah, I know.

234
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,125
Looking for anything in particular?

235
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,250
No, I'm just checking some stuff out.

236
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,667
Noncommittal.
Classic loser mentality. I can help.

237
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:08,780
I'm starting a mentorship program for
people who want to win at the game of life.

238
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:10,459
50 bucks an hour.

239
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,292
Cool. How do you actually win at life?

240
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,792
That's literally the answer
I charge money for.

241
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,459
Tots. What's with the breakfast pizza?

242
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,542
My sister made it. I'm supposed to
hand out slices at school to make friends.

243
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,417
A little desperate for day one,
don't you think?

244
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,280
I also noticed that you're
wearing Velvet Mischief.

245
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:30,084
It's a wonderful cologne.

246
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,375
And I strongly believe that every young man
should have his own signature scent.

247
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,334
I didn't think I applied very much.

248
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,792
Listen, I'm gonna give you a hot garbage tip.

249
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,917
Friendship is like a puzzle. Sometimes
you think you need lots of pieces to be cool.

250
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,917
And sometimes it's just one piece to be cool.

251
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:48,834
Then people will be like,
"That's not a puzzle. That's a picture."

252
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,375
And they have a right to speak, too.

253
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,709
Okay, well, I gotta go to school.

254
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,375
Whatever, nerd. Just leave the pizza.

255
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,375
All right! Let's put this name tag on!

256
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,167
Uh, why does it have an exclamation point?

257
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,750
Oh, Henry, we're just
so thrilled to have you.

258
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,322
You know, you're the first
student to enroll here

259
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,834
ever since that article came out
about the school rankings.

260
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:19,334
Anyway, I'm Vice Principal Marlene,
and I'm an open book.

261
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:22,959
You probably heard that my husband
Clemente recently divorced me.

262
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,625
And to be honest, I expected it
to hurt more than it does.

263
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:30,375
You know, the fire went out
on our marriage 20 years ago.

264
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,500
But we stuck it out for the dogs.

265
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,500
Okay, let's get you to your first class.

266
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,584
Good morning! Just a little
something about myself.

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,167
I teach gym, I teach art.

268
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,530
Financially,

269
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,250
I'm living in a nightmare, okay?

270
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,125
I wouldn't wish my life on my worst enemy.

271
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,167
Last year, I claimed $4,000 on my tax return.

272
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,292
I also have several pending lawsuits, okay?

273
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,667
But most of my money is tied up
in a drone kiosk at the mall.

274
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:05,250
Okay, today we're gonna do a still life.

275
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,334
One orange, one banana.

276
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,084
Let's get after it, people!

277
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,875
What is this? Don't you
know what a still life is?

278
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,375
It means you just draw the thing.

279
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,000
Do the assignment next time.

280
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,542
That jetpack would never work.

281
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,709
It's kind of foolproof, actually.
It's just math.

282
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,125
My dad said math has been debunked.

283
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,292
Check it out. New kid thinks
he's a rocket scientist.

284
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,680
I'd love to be a rocket scientist.
-So prove it.

285
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:16,167
Loser.

286
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,292
Alright, count us down, guys!

287
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,292
Five, four,

288
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,709
three, two, one!

289
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,709
Okay, so I know that we're all
very excited about the new rebrand.

290
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:35,750
But I don't think you should call
your party bags "salt sacks".

291
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,584
Chuggy!
-Oh no!

292
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,292
I was never here, okay?

293
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,292
Well, the good news is nobody died.

294
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:09,167
But the bad news is you've destroyed
the American potato chip economy.

295
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,875
I'm sorry, okay? It was an accident.

296
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,209
This could be grounds for expulsion, Henry.

297
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,084
I need you to call your guardian.

298
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:23,917
Game Over World.

299
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,459
Hey, Mr. Garbage Man, it's Henry,
the kid with the tater-top breakfast pizza.

300
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,292
Oh, yeah.

301
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,417
I have a weird favor to ask.

302
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,667
Could you come to my school
and pretend to be my uncle?

303
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,375
No way, I don't do that stuff anymore.

304
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,750
I have 26 bucks.

305
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hi, I'm Henry's uncle.

306
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:51,084
You? The Trash Bag?

307
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,375
It's actually Garbage Man.

308
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,709
Garbage Man, huh?

309
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,834
Oh, you can bag me up
and take me to the curb anytime.

310
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,917
But you gotta bungee the lid,
'cause I got a lot of raccoons in there.

311
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,959
Whoever divorced you is a complete idiot.

312
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,220
I just don't get it.

313
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,542
It should have worked.

314
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,375
The math is right, but I probably
just cost my sister her job.

315
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,292
Oh, wow.

316
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,875
You're super creative.

317
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,125
Guess I'm not the only
true talent in Chuglass.

318
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,709
Hey, uh, since you're going to juvie,
mind if I get this flyer back?

319
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,238
Paper don't grow on trees, and...

320
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,209
I'm not really allowed in Kinko's anymore.

321
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,580
Well, you can have my book, too.

322
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:42,834
Because I'm done with it.

323
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,334
So what's this stupid junk?

324
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,000
Who cares?

325
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,792
Probably some New Age bullcrap.

326
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,250
I wonder what it does.

327
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,584
Hey. Instructions.

328
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:07,459
"Never under any circumstances
combine the orb and crystal."

329
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,584
Uh, wait, uh...

330
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,363
"Do not follow this orb!

331
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:23,822
"Even if you're a struggling business
owner and need a ton of cash fast

332
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:26,125
"because there's loads of treasure down here.

333
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,459
"But it's not worth the danger!"

334
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:31,792
Hey, hey, dude? Dude, it feels
like it wants to go somewhere!

335
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:33,292
What?

336
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,417
I'm sorry.

337
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,430
I tried everything,
I didn't know who else to call.

338
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,000
No, it's okay. What's going on?

339
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:42,875
Henry's missing. I tried the school,

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,770
I tried his phone a million times,
he's not answering.

341
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,167
He was supposed to be home hours ago!

342
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:49,459
I thought he'd still be in detention
for blowing up Chuggy the Chip.

343
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,375
That was him?
-Give me the phone.

344
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,584
Oh my gosh.

345
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:57,334
I can't believe this. We're here for one
day and he's already the town villain.

346
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:58,417
Got him.

347
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:01,625
He's fine, he's just playing
in an abandoned mine shaft.

348
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,084
What?

349
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,209
Come on. I'll drive.

350
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,613
You can feed Mr. Scribbles this busted carrot

351
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:09,417
if you want to keep that
pretty face of yours.

352
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,667
Hop in.
-Okay...

353
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,792
You go first, I'll cover your six.

354
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,917
"Danger." Whatever.

355
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,417
Whoa.

356
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,750
Henry!
-Oh, gosh!

357
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,959
What are you doing down here?

358
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:54,042
Who's this guy?
-He's my new mentor.

359
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,709
Who, me? No.

360
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,959
Hey, guys? Guys!

361
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:00,875
It's pulling me, guys!

362
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,917
No!
-Woah, woah!

363
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,792
Henry!

364
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,167
Henry! Let go of that thing!

365
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,292
Oh, man! My butt!

366
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:35,459
My butt!

367
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,292
We're not in Idaho anymore.

368
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,417
I think this is Wyoming.

369
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,625
Wait, who are you again?

370
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,709
Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.

371
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,667
Gamer of the Year, 1989.

372
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,417
Whatever. I barely think about it.

373
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:19,375
What the heck?

374
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,334
Ooh.

375
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:23,834
If that's what I think it is...

376
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,750
it could be our first quest giver.

377
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,334
I'll do the talking.

378
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,792
Alright! Yeah!

379
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,625
Henry!
-Yeah, Henry!

380
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:33,917
Come on back here!

381
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,167
Listen up, you swine!

382
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,459
We're running dangerously low on gold.

383
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,709
So let me be very clear.

384
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,292
You are all failures!

385
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,459
If you can't find more gold,

386
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,625
I'll just send you
to the Overworld to zombify!

387
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,792
Find me more gold!

388
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:13,917
You!

389
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,250
What are you making?

390
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,709
Come closer. It's alright.

391
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,917
Come on, I'm not going to bite you.

392
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,042
Aww, how pretty!

393
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:29,250
But how will that help me find more gold?

394
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:31,500
Oops!

395
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:34,709
What?

396
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:39,709
Well, looky what we have here.

397
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,209
Our time has come!

398
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,834
Malgosha! My liege!

399
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:09,292
Was I unclear when I said no one
was to waste time on art or leisure?

400
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,292
The Orb has returned.

401
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:17,959
It can't be.

402
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:19,667
Dennis?

403
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,292
You stole it from me,
and now you will retrieve it.

404
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,584
It would be a privilege, my liege.

405
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,042
We're going to unbind you now.

406
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,375
Don't do anything stupid.

407
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:36,459
Of course not. You can
trust this little dungeon pup.

408
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,959
Let me just-- Sneak attack!

409
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,834
Go ahead, strike me down.

410
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,917
My piglins will make a meal
of your beautiful wolf.

411
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,584
How do I know you're telling the truth?

412
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:49,000
There's only one way to find out.

413
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,042
The Orb for your little dog's life.

414
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,209
Hola, wise quest giver.

415
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,530
We humbly seek gold.

416
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,640
Give us a quest that will
lead us to your treasure load.

417
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,125
Garbage Man, I work in the animal field

418
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:33,542
and I am telling you that thing
doesn't understand a word you're saying.

419
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,667
Shh, we're talking.

420
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,209
Sorry about that. What were you saying?

421
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,709
Okay. Come on, Henry, we're going home.

422
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:49,750
That feel quick to anyone else?

423
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:01,625
All right, everyone, stay calm.

424
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,042
Relaje.

425
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:05,709
Free garbage tip.

426
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,625
Fear is just weakness
hijacking your body's cockpit.

427
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:12,834
What in the hell?

428
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:13,988
And if that happens,

429
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:18,542
you can say "bye-oh con dias" to your
body plane's navigation system.

430
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:19,875
What?

431
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:23,167
Yeah, Garbage Man isn't
speaking English or Espanol.

432
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,625
What am I doing here?

433
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:35,542
Run!

434
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,542
Garrett!

435
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,000
Sorry, dead dudes can't win
Gamer of the Year!

436
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:10,834
Henry!

437
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,917
Yo, we got a zombie problem!

438
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,292
How's he doing that?
-I don't know, but it might work!

439
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,697
This way, faster!

440
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,542
You got this, you got this!
-Go, Henry!

441
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:04,125
Hurry now! Don't you
fall down, you can do this!

442
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,625
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorr--

443
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,417
Help me! Help me, please!

444
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:09,441
Garrett!

445
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:10,875
Garrett, over here!

446
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:21,084
What are you doing? Leave those things!
Come here! Oh my gosh!

447
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,209
You idiot! Run!

448
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,667
Look out!

449
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,834
Open the door!

450
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:48,980
Oh man.

451
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:51,084
Oh boy!

452
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:55,834
Hank!

453
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,084
Oh man.

454
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,834
Sneak attack!

455
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,292
Uh-oh.

456
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,834
Who are you?

457
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,375
I...

458
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,399
am Steve.

459
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,667
Who are you people? Where's Dennis?

460
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,000
Dennis? Who's... We don't know any Dennis.

461
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,459
Then how'd you get that?
-Hey!

462
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,000
Relaje, muchaho. This is my property.

463
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,542
Do you even know what that is?

464
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,917
It's the Orb of Dominance.

465
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,000
It's a cube.

466
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,459
Okay, ho-ho...

467
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,542
You people seriously have
no idea what you're dealing with.

468
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,350
Hand it over and no one gets hurt.

469
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,030
No way! Okay, we need this thing to get home.

470
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,959
I hate to take a big fat
dumperoo on your plans,

471
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,375
but you can't get home!

472
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,542
Whoa, whoa, wait.
What do you mean, we can't get home?

473
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,292
Not without the Earth Crystal.

474
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,125
You mean that little boxy thing?

475
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,790
Garbage Man busted it!

476
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,542
Nuh-uh.

477
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,209
Listen, Henry, why don't you hold this?

478
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,292
You got those good Frodo vibes, kid.

479
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:21,542
I got Frodo vibes.

480
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,459
Are you implying that we're stuck here?

481
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,292
Yes! Unless you get the Earth Crystal,
it's your only way home.

482
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,125
There's only one way
you could ever replace it,

483
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:33,584
at the Woodland Mansion,
but going there would get you all killed.

484
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,000
But so would staying here!

485
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,000
Fair enough.

486
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:40,209
Listen, I can get you home,
but then you gotta give me that orb.

487
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,875
So what are you gonna do with it?

488
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,375
None of your concern!

489
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,750
So, what do you say? Do we have a deal?

490
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:48,834
He did just kill like 20 zombies.

491
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,209
Pfft. More like 15, but okay.

492
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,292
All right, Steve.

493
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:58,167
Under two conditions. One, always
address me, because I'm the leader.

494
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,550
Two, if you double-cross us...

495
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,584
I will crack your cabasa
with my buttcheeks like a walnut.

496
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,667
This guy is such a toolbag.

497
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:11,375
I'm so sorry, we just met this man.

498
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,959
And he's not the leader.
-Humph!

499
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:17,667
Well, it looks like Dr. Swollenstein here
just got himself a deal.

500
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,792
Oh my gosh.

501
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:29,417
All right, first we need to load up
on some gear or we're all gonna die.

502
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:30,709
Let's go to Midport Village!

503
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,917
This guy's lost his mind.

504
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,042
Move out!

505
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,000
Here it is! Midport Village!

506
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,167
I got a secret stash of elite loot that'll
help us survive the Woodland Mansion.

507
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who are these guys?

508
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:55,750
Oh, these dudes? They're the villagers!

509
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,250
They're total pacifists and vegetarians.

510
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,084
You don't bug them, they won't bug you.

511
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:04,000
They just like to chill, trade
and eat buttloads of bread.

512
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:05,375
They love crushing loaf.

513
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,667
So they built all this?

514
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,250
Yeah, most of it.

515
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:11,667
But the good stuff you see is all me.

516
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,709
Whoa, is he some kind of king?

517
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:16,875
No.

518
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,470
That's a legend.

519
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,792
Kid, anything you can dream
about here, you can make.

520
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,459
Zero limits. You know what I'm talking about.

521
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,459
That was your tower, right?
-Yeah.

522
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,750
Pretty killer for a first build.

523
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:37,625
Relax, it's just an iron golem,
local security force.

524
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,917
But they're a bunch of big softies!

525
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,167
Unless you start messing with the villagers.
Don't ever do that!

526
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,875
This place makes no sense.

527
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:53,125
Yo, I need protein, like, pronto.

528
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,167
I got just the place, brohemoth.

529
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,209
Hello there.

530
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,750
Oh dude, I got goose pimples
just walking up on it.

531
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:11,709
You ever wonder what happens
when you mix hot lava and chicken?

532
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:14,340
I did. And you're about to find out.

533
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:15,834
Pfft.

534
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,417
Uh-oh!

535
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:25,500
You hear that?

536
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,792
That's the sound of sizzlean.

537
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:30,917
Mm-hm. Smell my smell.

538
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:35,000
<i>La-la-la-lava! Ch-ch-ch-chicken!</i>

539
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,375
<i>Steve's Lava Chicken,
yeah, it's tasty as hell</i>

540
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,209
<i>Ooh, mamacita, now you're ringing the bell</i>

541
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:44,334
<i>Crispy and juicy, now you're having a snack</i>

542
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:48,542
<i>Ooh, super spicy, it's a lava attack</i>

543
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,834
I have a small business too.

544
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,459
The one thing I try to do
is not have my jingles suck butt.

545
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,084
Friggin' loser.

546
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,250
Pass the bird, turkey.

547
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,792
I'm not a little wimp like big Steve here.

548
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,459
I crave heat, and I crave pain.

549
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,709
Garrett, wait!

550
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,917
Hear my words.

551
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,042
That chicken was just cooked in hot lava.

552
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:17,542
Let it cool down, man.

553
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:29,500
Not bad.

554
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,917
Garbage Man, you're a big-time idiot.

555
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,020
What is it?

556
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:46,959
What?

557
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:50,500
General Chungus!

558
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:51,959
Get over here!

559
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:05,834
Hey, Malgosha. What's going on?

560
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:09,542
Your old dungeon buddy Steve has betrayed us.

561
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,875
Well, that's a bummer.

562
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:13,417
The Orb is with four roundlings.

563
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:17,542
My spies tell me he has taken them
to his lava chicken shack.

564
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,750
No way!

565
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,500
I love that place!

566
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,792
<i>La-la-la-lava! Ch-ch-ch-chicken!</i>

567
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:23,625
Shut up!

568
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,322
Take your finest warriors,
bring me that orb,

569
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:27,750
and kill the roundlings!

570
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:30,959
So like, you want me
to end his life or whatever?

571
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,375
Are you serious?

572
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,250
What do you think I'm talking about?

573
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:37,875
Okay, I was just kind of
confused there for a second.

574
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,584
Take this nether wart so you don't zombify.

575
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,238
Um, your majesty,

576
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:45,667
I don't think this is going to be
enough to go around.

577
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,875
Deal with it!
-No worries.

578
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,792
All right, drink up, guys.

579
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,834
You don't want to zombify up there,
but just tiny sips, okay?

580
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,042
Okay, so how do we find
this Woodland Mansion thing?

581
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:06,417
Over the mountains, into the dark forest,
right beyond the massive red shrooms.

582
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,209
Massive red shrooms?
-Mm-hmm.

583
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:09,834
Big old red ones.

584
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:12,584
We need to find a real map, Steve.

585
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,292
This place is dangerous,
and I need to get my brother out of here.

586
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,459
Well, it seems like he's having
a pretty good time.

587
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:20,417
Look, your brother has a gift,
you know that, right?

588
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,334
You should let him explore it.

589
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,917
Creativity in this world is key to survival.

590
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,084
Okay, well, in the real world,
things are a little bit different.

591
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,697
Creative kids get picked last for gym,

592
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,334
they sit at the bummer lunch table,
and they get bullied.

593
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,209
Don't I know it.

594
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:36,875
Do you even realize what he did back home?

595
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,000
He blew up Chuggy the Chip.

596
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:40,917
Well, maybe I belong in this world.

597
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,542
Henry, that's not what I meant...

598
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,042
It's not what I was saying at all...

599
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:48,655
Just so you know,

600
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,792
I'm more of a sister to Hank
than he'll ever be.

601
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:54,375
Yeah.

602
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:57,667
Spin kick!

603
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,250
You okay?

604
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:01,792
Fine.

605
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:06,084
Look, I found one of these big-headed
looking dudes that sells maps.

606
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,750
Looks legit. Come on.

607
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,209
Welcome to the stash.

608
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:13,834
TNT.

609
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,375
Firework rockets.

610
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,834
Also good for propulsion.

611
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,542
Boots of swiftness.

612
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,260
Diamond armor. Full set.

613
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,625
And blades for days.

614
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,250
Everything we'll need to make it
to Woodland Mansion.

615
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,875
Whoa.

616
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,417
Bogus layout, bro.

617
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:33,875
Look but don't touch.

618
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,750
Those are some of my favorite treasures.

619
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:47,875
What's this junk?

620
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,167
That is an ender pearl.

621
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,200
Teleports you to wherever you throw it.

622
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,334
Yeah, right.
-No!

623
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:58,625
Oh god.

624
00:43:58,959 --> 00:43:59,834
What the...

625
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,920
And that was the only one I had.

626
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:02,959
No biggie.

627
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,375
Almost died fighting an enderman for it.

628
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,000
Come with me.

629
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:15,667
This is a crafting table.

630
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:16,875
Here's how it works.

631
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,792
You place these elements
in different patterns and...

632
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:22,084
hit 'em!

633
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,500
You got yourself a sweet blade.

634
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,250
You want to see a blade?

635
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,834
I'll show you a blade.

636
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:34,917
Yeah!

637
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,250
Kaboosh!

638
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,334
That's okay, bud. Buckets are useful here.

639
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,417
Yeah, they're cool, Garrett.
They're like nunchucks.

640
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,459
Yeah, I know.

641
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:51,750
That's why I made them.

642
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:53,697
They're...

643
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:55,792
buck-chuckets.

644
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,542
Uh, they're what?

645
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:03,625
Hey, can I try something else?
-Abso-rootin'-tootly.

646
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,584
Bro, you had tots the whole time?
-Yeah, sorry.

647
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:16,750
It's a tot launcher.

648
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:21,250
Dude, you just took boring junk from
the real world to create something amazing.

649
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:22,667
That is next level!

650
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,334
Hank, can I play with your
tot launcher when you're done?

651
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,959
Yeah.
-Sweet.

652
00:45:27,209 --> 00:45:27,834
Hey, Steve.

653
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,500
Can I talk to you for a second?

654
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,709
Sure thing.

655
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,042
What's up?

656
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:40,917
You know that note you left with the orb?

657
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,500
The one about the riches?

658
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,834
I read it.
-Yeah.

659
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,375
There's riches everywhere.

660
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,959
I keep a fat stash of diamonds
at the Redstone Mines.

661
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:51,709
So this treasure load,
is it on the way to this mansion place?

662
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,084
Not really, it's a major detour.

663
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,667
Plus, the mines can be perilous.

664
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,459
I'm gonna keep it simple for you, Steve.

665
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:01,084
No diamonds...

666
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:02,792
no orb.

667
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,500
You smell what I'm steppin' in?

668
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,292
Good day.

669
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,125
We need a map to the Woodland Mansion.

670
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,000
We just need a map.

671
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Uh-oh.

672
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:26,459
Nat?
-Dawn?

673
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,750
Something's going down!

674
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:50,667
All right, guys.

675
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,917
Just start trashing their produce.

676
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,584
Villagers hate that.

677
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,625
Who are these guys?
-Piglins.

678
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,209
They must be after the orb.

679
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:31,042
Hey, Steve!

680
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:33,125
What's going on, dude?

681
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,375
Crap! Chungus.

682
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:39,334
I'm really sorry, but I have to
annihilate you and stuff.

683
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:42,292
Malkosha double-crossed me.

684
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:44,834
We just need that orb thingy.

685
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:45,834
You know this guy?

686
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,084
Yeah, we used to get into some dungeon stuff.

687
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,292
He seems nice, but he's a killer!

688
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:52,875
Wow, you look good, brohammer.

689
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,125
You lose some weight?

690
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,542
Stand back, boys.

691
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,000
This pig is mine.
-No!

692
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,584
I'm tired of you getting all the glory.

693
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:03,750
This pig is mine.

694
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,334
Steve!

695
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:31,584
We have to get to Henry!
Do you think we can take these guys?

696
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:16,750
Nice moves, bro!

697
00:49:19,584 --> 00:49:20,375
Sorry!

698
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:36,667
The party's over, bud.

699
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,125
Just give me the orb.

700
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,167
No, please, don't! Let me tell you something!

701
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:44,792
Ninja roll.

702
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,125
What happened?

703
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,084
I saved your butt, that's what happened.

704
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,334
You can thank me later.

705
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,834
We gotta get to the rampart.

706
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,760
Follow me!

707
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,084
Henry!

708
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,330
Nat, we have to go now!
-Dawn, I cannot leave him,

709
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,792
he's my entire family!
-He needs you alive, okay?

710
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:14,000
We'll meet him back at the Woodland Mansion.
We gotta go find the map guy, come on!

711
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,667
Garrett, what about Natalie?
-We'll meet her at the mansion!

712
00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:32,709
Oh, great. Now what?

713
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:35,292
Elytra wingsuits.

714
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:38,917
Whoa!

715
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,209
Head for those mountains!

716
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,416
I thought we were going
to the Woodland Mansion.

717
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,875
Hank, don't talk back to your elders.
-But...

718
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:43,709
Buh-bye.

719
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:50,542
Those things work, right?

720
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:51,584
Absolutely.

721
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:01,292
Check it out! I'm flying!

722
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,316
Yeah!

723
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:07,917
Buenos dias.

724
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,167
Which means "see you later".

725
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,584
I thought I grabbed three!

726
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,875
Wait for me!

727
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,084
Comin' in hot!

728
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,542
No! No way, dude!

729
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,167
Let go of my hair!

730
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,750
Just relax. Let my hips guide you,
it's the only way!

731
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,542
What?

732
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:47,959
Hank!

733
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,125
We'll have a better chance if we split up!

734
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,209
What?

735
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,167
Get off me, you stupid pig!

736
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:10,750
Get off me!

737
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,417
We got hog riders, they're at three o'clock!

738
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,417
They got us boxed in! Head for the tunnel!

739
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,334
We're not gonna fit! We're too chunky!

740
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:55,125
We're gonna have to go nose to toes.

741
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,375
Full man sandwich!

742
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,334
What? No, I'm not gonna do that!

743
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,209
I'm ordering you to make a full man sandwich!

744
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,167
Okay!

745
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:07,750
Oh my god! Garrett!

746
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:12,280
Yeah! Woohoo!

747
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:14,167
Dang it! A lava bucket!

748
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,334
Okay, tighten up!

749
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,167
What?

750
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:19,292
There's still some negative space back there!

751
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,292
We both know it!

752
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:22,084
I'm trying to close the gaps!

753
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm gonna squeeze for your safety!
-I understand!

754
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:37,125
Yeah! Woohoo!

755
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:45,750
Get off me, you stupid pig!

756
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:47,042
Get off me!

757
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,292
Henry!

758
00:54:00,084 --> 00:54:01,084
Oh, crap!

759
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,584
Don't worry! I'm gonna cushion our fall
with this water bucket!

760
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:17,250
Really?

761
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,600
You can really fight, Nat!
You were kicking butt!

762
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,625
Thanks! I have no idea where it came from!

763
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,880
There he is! He's getting away!

764
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,820
Hey, get back here! We need a map!

765
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,209
First we need a boat!
-Okay, okay, uh...

766
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,417
Okay, hurry!

767
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,917
The map guy's floating away!

768
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,792
Boat magic!

769
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,084
Nat, that's the worst boat I've ever seen.

770
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm sorry, I have no idea what I'm doing.

771
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,417
Forget it! Let's go, come on!

772
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:17,750
Oh, no! Not again!

773
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:20,667
I am so sorry!

774
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,250
Oh my god! Are you all right?

775
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,417
Oh my god! Oh my god, Are you all right?

776
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,000
Your head is huge!

777
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,000
You're not gonna sue me, are you?

778
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:37,667
Because everyone wants to sue me once
I hit them with my Jeep Grand Cherokee!

779
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,334
Oh, my!

780
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:42,709
How about this, what if
I just take you to dinner?

781
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:45,000
Would you like to go to dinner?

782
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:49,209
You got some talking to do, buddy.

783
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,667
Hank and I want some answers.

784
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,990
Like, how are we going to stop those pigs?

785
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,584
And why does my beard smell like gorgonzola?

786
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,310
Yeah, and who's that evil sorceress
you were talking about?

787
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:56,125
Look!

788
00:55:56,917 --> 00:55:59,375
The sorceress is a piglin queen
called Malgosha.

789
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:00,709
Those are her minions.

790
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,917
She rules over them in a dark
hellscape called the Nether.

791
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:08,042
And I always keep a chunk of gorgonzola
in my front pocket, okay?

792
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:11,292
It's my best friend's favorite snacky-snack.

793
00:56:14,209 --> 00:56:15,167
My best friend, Dennis.

794
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:19,959
Malgosha's path to villainy
started the way these things often do.

795
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:24,334
During the semi-finals
of The Nether's Got Talent.

796
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Young Malgosha always dreamed
of being a world-class dancer.

797
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,334
Her moves were pretty out there.

798
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,750
No one in the Nether was ready for it.

799
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:43,792
It crushed her.

800
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,417
What'd I tell you about all that dancing?

801
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,500
You deserve to fail.

802
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,667
Creativity will never make you happy.

803
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:54,209
But you know what will?

804
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:57,209
Gold! Now go find some!

805
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:01,750
So from that day forward,
she denounced all forms of creativity.

806
00:57:03,459 --> 00:57:06,875
If she ever gets that orb,
she'll block out the sun.

807
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:08,917
Nether wart will flourish.

808
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,700
This beautiful world and everything in it
will wither and die!

809
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,000
And you were gonna give it to her?

810
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:14,375
Great idea.

811
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:16,209
I'm not gonna give it to her.

812
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,250
But I need that orb for leverage.

813
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,042
Gotta save Dennis.

814
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,750
Come.

815
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,959
The Woodland Mansion is just
beyond the Redstone Mountains.

816
00:57:27,584 --> 00:57:29,667
We can go over, or through.

817
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:31,292
Whatever's fastest.

818
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:35,042
Through will be faster.

819
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,292
General Changus!

820
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,167
You have failed me for the last time!

821
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:47,900
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

822
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,667
Bring out the beast!

823
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,334
What? What do you mean,
you just have to put the brain in?

824
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:57,875
Well, yes, it's a big deal. Get it done!

825
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:01,000
Look, everybody knows it wasn't my best day.

826
00:58:01,334 --> 00:58:03,667
But I'm really trying to set some new goals.

827
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:15,917
The Great Hog!

828
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:17,667
My ultimate weapon.

829
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,209
There it is!

830
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:27,334
Kill him!

831
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,417
Wait, does this mean you're firing me?

832
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:34,917
Well done!

833
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,375
Now find the roundlings,
and bring me the orb!

834
00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:44,042
We are so lost.

835
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:54,500
My one job was to protect Henry,
and I blew it!

836
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,792
I just promised my mom I'd never let
anything happen to him.

837
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:02,209
I guess I'm just not cut out
for this parenting stuff.

838
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:10,209
I just wish I could have been a kid
for a little bit longer, you know?

839
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,917
Just to have that feeling
like I could have done anything.

840
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,875
I hear you.

841
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,667
Being a grown-up sucks.

842
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:20,542
You got all these responsibilities,
and you just stop chasing your dreams.

843
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:25,125
You think I like having 15 hustles?

844
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,959
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up, hold up.

845
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:38,917
Let's just calm down.

846
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:42,542
I think this one just needs some TLC.

847
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,042
Yeah? You like bones?

848
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:50,875
Oh, I bet you like bones!
Yes, you do! Yes, you do!

849
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:56,209
Aren't you a beautiful one?

850
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:59,084
Yes, you are! Oh, yes, you are!

851
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:02,375
I cannot believe you just did that.

852
01:00:06,084 --> 01:00:06,917
Dennis?

853
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:09,042
Steve's Dennis?

854
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:11,500
Well, can you take us to him?

855
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:18,459
Oh, Nat, I think this might be
our way to the Woodland Mansion.

856
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:21,875
Let's follow that pooch!

857
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:26,709
Right this way, gentlemen.

858
01:00:27,209 --> 01:00:30,417
Woohoohoo! Lookie, lookie here.

859
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,334
Welcome to the Redstone Mines.

860
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:37,084
You see that glowy stuff? That's redstone.

861
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,500
Conducts energy.

862
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,250
You can build some
crazy contraptions with it.

863
01:00:43,084 --> 01:00:44,875
I thought you said this was a diamond mine.

864
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,417
Easy, big dog. They're here.

865
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,875
But be careful.

866
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,459
I set some booby traps a long time ago.

867
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:54,334
but I can't for the life of me
remember where they are.

868
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,209
Get them off me!

869
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:07,584
Help me, please!

870
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:16,959
Hah! Here it is. Thanks, Garrett.

871
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,834
Ooh yeah.

872
01:01:21,084 --> 01:01:22,167
Yes.

873
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:26,167
The diamonds.
-That's what I'm talking about!

874
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:28,625
Steve delivers the goods!

875
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:29,959
Did you guys plan this?

876
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,125
I'm sorry, Henry.

877
01:01:32,959 --> 01:01:33,834
Woo!

878
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:35,834
Yeah! I'm not.

879
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:39,625
Yeah!
-What the heck, man?

880
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:42,167
Oh, relax.
-Natalie could be at the mansion already.

881
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,917
Did you fart?

882
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:48,875
Oh no.

883
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,750
Nether wart.

884
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,500
What does that mean?

885
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:00,709
No! The Great Hog!

886
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,667
She finally put the brain in.

887
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,375
Run for the minecart!

888
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,334
Hit it, Henry! Hit it!

889
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:13,542
Go!

890
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:21,292
If memory serves, I built
a kick-ass safe room just up ahead!

891
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,500
Dang it, my torch blew out.

892
01:02:27,959 --> 01:02:30,417
Why are we stopping?
-We're a husky load, gents.

893
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,459
We're gonna need a redstone boost, fast.

894
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,042
What's that sound?

895
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,042
Crap!

896
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:38,750
My creeper farm.

897
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,667
What kind of idiot would breed these things?

898
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,334
Up ahead, look!

899
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,459
We gotta get to the redstone rail!

900
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,250
Garrett, you got us into this mess.
Get out and push!

901
01:02:58,084 --> 01:03:00,542
Okay. Okay...

902
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,000
Go, Garrett, go faster!

903
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:09,250
We're not gonna make it!

904
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,709
Come on!
-Come on, Garrett, you've gotta go faster!

905
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,334
Start slapping, Hank!

906
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,209
Garrett, get in!

907
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:20,625
He's right behind us!

908
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:44,167
Woohoo!

909
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:45,917
Yeah!

910
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,500
Woohoo!

911
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,792
Nice work, Gar-Gar,
your little detour almost got us killed.

912
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:57,459
Blah blah, you're so dramatic.
We're still alive.

913
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,750
What's your problem, man?

914
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,709
We didn't need those stupid diamonds.

915
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,709
I swear, you are literally
the most selfish person I've ever met.

916
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,375
Whatever. I need them.

917
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,417
Okay? I need the diamonds,
because I need the money, because I'm broke.

918
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,917
You wouldn't know anything about that.

919
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:15,834
My life sucks, kid. All right?

920
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:17,292
I'm a frickin' loser.

921
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:19,500
There, I said it.

922
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:22,084
I know, it looks like I got it all
put together, right?

923
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,959
I'm smart, funny, bilingual.

924
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,584
El humble to un el faulto.

925
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:33,542
That's not the reality.

926
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,750
I'm not doing well. I'm bad.

927
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,584
I'm washed up, Hank,
and I'm gonna lose everything.

928
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:44,125
And that's not the worst part.

929
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,000
I'm alone.

930
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:48,959
You weren't alone.

931
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:51,209
I was your friend.

932
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,625
Sorry about your finances.

933
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,625
Shut up, Steve.

934
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,750
Oh, no, thank you.

935
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:31,417
You know, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

936
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,042
I recently got divorced
from my husband, Clemente.

937
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:39,155
And, and the main reason is,

938
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,500
you know, he didn't have any personality.

939
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,292
Not like you.

940
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:47,959
Are you finished?

941
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:49,792
No, I think he's Swedish.

942
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,792
But we're done with our meal.

943
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,042
There it is.

944
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:56,584
The Woodland Mansion.

945
01:05:56,834 --> 01:06:00,167
We're gonna get in there,
get the Earth Crystal, and get you guys home.

946
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:01,292
Follow me!

947
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,209
Check this out.

948
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:05,125
Let's do this.

949
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,334
Pay close attention to Papa Steve.

950
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:09,625
The Woodland Mansion has three floors.

951
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:13,250
The first floor is loaded with vindicators.

952
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:14,875
Axe murderers, basically.

953
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,667
Why is the third floor on the first floor?
I'm very confused.

954
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,530
I was trying to make three floors,

955
01:06:19,554 --> 01:06:21,500
but I didn't have time
to make, like, a dollhouse.

956
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,750
The second floor crawls with evokers.

957
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,084
They wield powerful dark magic.

958
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:28,875
This is the worst model I've ever seen.

959
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:31,167
Garrett, stop talking,
we're trying to figure out a plan.

960
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,917
Bro, how long are you gonna be mad at me for?
-I just got mad at you!

961
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:35,667
Please don't be mad at me for this, okay?

962
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:38,000
But I accidentally stole the orb
while you were crafting.

963
01:06:39,959 --> 01:06:40,625
We cool now?

964
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:44,209
You are literally the worst person
in the entire world.

965
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,000
Guys!

966
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,417
Both of you, eyes on my demonstraysh!

967
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,334
Third floor houses the loot chamber.

968
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,290
That's where the Earth Crystal is.

969
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,417
But it's guarded by endermen.

970
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,417
Whatever you do, do not look them in the eye.

971
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,917
They'll fry your brains out.

972
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,917
Okay, well, I could build
stairs to the second floor,

973
01:07:00,959 --> 01:07:03,000
sneak in through the window,
and snag the Earth Crystal.

974
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:04,417
That's a great idea, Hank.

975
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:07,417
But to pull it off, we're gonna
need a pretty sweet diversion.

976
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,667
You know what could work on these guys?

977
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,084
It sounds crazy.
-Hit me.

978
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,834
Someone order a saxophone birthday party?

979
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,292
Looks like it's everyone's birthday. Hit it!

980
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:30,488
<i>Friendship is the wish you make</i>

981
01:07:30,584 --> 01:07:32,667
<i>When you're blowing out the candles
on your birthday cake</i>

982
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,834
<i>Don't be a bully and don't be a brute</i>

983
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,000
<i>Time to put on your birthday suit</i>

984
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,125
<i>Today is the best, it's the day you were born</i>

985
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,334
<i>Time for us to blow the birthday horn</i>

986
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:45,625
You gotta be kidding me.

987
01:08:47,459 --> 01:08:49,000
You got this, Gar-Gar!

988
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,292
Reach down deep!

989
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,250
You're the Chuglass Kid and I love you!

990
01:08:54,584 --> 01:08:55,584
What's going on, Steve?

991
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,125
It's some kind of sadistic
vindicator fight club.

992
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,542
I've heard of these, but I've never seen one.

993
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,167
They want me to fight the chicken?

994
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,125
It's a fight to the death, Kid!

995
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,709
Chicken jockey!

996
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:37,917
Watch out!

997
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,375
Keep him away from your face!

998
01:10:33,334 --> 01:10:34,417
Finally!

999
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,334
I'm sorry, little buddy.

1000
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,167
Don't fall for it, Gar-Gar!

1001
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,334
That baby's got the heart of a demon!

1002
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,125
No, you're not a demon, are you?

1003
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:29,584
You're a cute little booger-face.

1004
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:32,042
I'm just gonna pet your little head.

1005
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,584
You'll never be as cool as me, Hank.

1006
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,750
Just give up.

1007
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:48,125
The Overworld doesn't need you, Henry.

1008
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:49,750
Neither do I.

1009
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,709
This is all your fault, Henry.

1010
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,834
Everything you do fails!

1011
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,625
This stuff? It's trash, kid.

1012
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:58,042
Just give up.

1013
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,542
You suck.

1014
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:17,542
I'm coming!

1015
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,167
Sneak attack!

1016
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,584
Bro!

1017
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,000
You...

1018
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:52,667
You saved my life.

1019
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:54,500
That's what friends do, Garrett.

1020
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:59,167
Hank! Did you get the Earth Crystal?

1021
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,375
Yeah, I got it.
-Let's get out of this hellhole!

1022
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:14,834
Where do you think you're going?

1023
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:16,667
It's her!

1024
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,459
You dummies!

1025
01:13:18,584 --> 01:13:21,709
You really thought you could
defeat my Great Hog?

1026
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:23,542
Newsflash!

1027
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:25,292
I built a new one.

1028
01:13:27,584 --> 01:13:28,709
Malgosha!

1029
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:30,542
Your reign is over!

1030
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:31,875
You're wrong.

1031
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,834
It's just beginning.

1032
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:38,334
No!

1033
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,405
No!

1034
01:13:41,429 --> 01:13:42,334
Kill them!

1035
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,209
We have work to do.

1036
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:47,209
Goodbye, Steve.

1037
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,584
Seeker piglins.

1038
01:13:54,834 --> 01:13:56,750
They're going to blow this bridge sky high!

1039
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,000
Sorry, Hank.

1040
01:13:58,292 --> 01:13:58,959
What?

1041
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:05,459
Yeah!

1042
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:07,000
Slime cube!

1043
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:17,792
Come on, Garrett! Jump!

1044
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,542
No, Steve! Get him out of here!

1045
01:14:19,959 --> 01:14:22,500
Go, Hank! Save your sister and get home!

1046
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:24,125
Garrett, you don't have to do this!

1047
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,709
No! Get him home, Steve!

1048
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,875
Tell my story in song!

1049
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:30,125
Keep it metal, keep it heavy.

1050
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:31,500
Real instruments.

1051
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:33,584
Besides...

1052
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:37,917
I love luaus.

1053
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:40,834
Spin kick!

1054
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:56,500
No!

1055
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:02,125
We're going down!

1056
01:15:02,584 --> 01:15:04,542
Brace for impact!

1057
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,792
Dennis?

1058
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:27,084
Dennis!

1059
01:15:27,959 --> 01:15:30,042
It's you! It's really you!

1060
01:15:32,459 --> 01:15:33,584
Oh, c'mon, gimme...

1061
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:40,084
How'd you find me?

1062
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,667
He's one heck of a wolf.

1063
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,542
He led us right to you guys.

1064
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,405
Now I understand why you
kept yourself so filthy and smelly

1065
01:15:46,429 --> 01:15:48,000
so Dennis could find you one day.

1066
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,375
Is he okay?

1067
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:52,250
He's fine. He's just resting.

1068
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:53,542
Good.

1069
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:55,625
It's a pretty rough crash landing.

1070
01:15:56,834 --> 01:15:58,167
Wait a minute, where are we?

1071
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,834
You guys both made this?

1072
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,542
Yeah! We're not messin' around.

1073
01:16:07,584 --> 01:16:09,834
We got the silk touch.
-No looker!

1074
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,834
I was so afraid that I lost you.

1075
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:20,334
I was so afraid that I lost you too.

1076
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:23,375
And I'm really sorry about Garrett.

1077
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:36,167
With this orb, I'll darken the Overworld,

1078
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:38,959
nether wart will spread like wildfire,

1079
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:41,709
and all its gold will be ours!

1080
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:14,292
It has begun.

1081
01:17:14,959 --> 01:17:16,084
The Great Darkening.

1082
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,875
Malgosha's gathering all her forces.

1083
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,667
She will destroy this land.

1084
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,334
Unless we go get that orb.

1085
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,917
Well, what are we doing here?

1086
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,375
Let's go fight some pigs!

1087
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:30,209
I'm ready.

1088
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:31,834
I'm done with those pigs.

1089
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,667
Yeah, me too.

1090
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:34,334
Let's do it for Gar-Gar.

1091
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:37,375
First we mine, then we craft.

1092
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,167
Let's minecraft!

1093
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,125
Right! One, two, three!

1094
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,530
Team!
-Get the orb!

1095
01:17:42,554 --> 01:17:43,834
What are you saying?
-"Minecraft."

1096
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:47,084
We should all say that, on three. One--
Forget it, there's no time!

1097
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,875
Show us what you got, Henry.

1098
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,667
Okay, I've got a plan.

1099
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,875
Killer recipes.

1100
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,040
We're going to have to move fast.

1101
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:55,250
Let's get to work.

1102
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,709
First, we're going to need iron ingots.

1103
01:17:59,084 --> 01:18:00,125
Coming in hot.

1104
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:05,209
Oh yeah!

1105
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:08,542
We're going to need the boots of swiftness.

1106
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,584
Time to light this place up.

1107
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,334
Come on, boys.

1108
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,709
Have a nice flight!

1109
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,667
Holy moly!

1110
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:27,500
We're gonna need a ton of diamonds.

1111
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:33,834
And blades for days.

1112
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,584
You want some, buddy?

1113
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:46,667
We're ready. Let's go save the Overworld!

1114
01:18:52,584 --> 01:18:54,500
Listen up, my piggies!

1115
01:18:56,625 --> 01:19:01,209
Today, we take the Overworld as ours!

1116
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,167
Attack their villages!

1117
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,209
Burn their homes and their symmetrical farms!

1118
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,459
All they have created,

1119
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,000
we destroy!

1120
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,792
Well, what are you standing around for?

1121
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:22,542
Get out of here! Go on, destroy something!

1122
01:19:33,584 --> 01:19:34,584
Hurry, Henry!

1123
01:20:11,584 --> 01:20:12,875
Newsflash!

1124
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,125
Iron golems will not attack unless provoked!

1125
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:26,834
Real smooth, Travis!

1126
01:20:46,334 --> 01:20:47,125
You ready?

1127
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,792
Let's do this.

1128
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,084
Oh, for goodness sake!

1129
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:06,625
Enjoying the show, are you?

1130
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:10,209
Get down there and take care
of those roundlings!

1131
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,459
How do you like them pork chops?

1132
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,334
Okay, Gosh.

1133
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:46,209
Let's dance.
-Bring it on!

1134
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:58,250
Sneak attack!

1135
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:08,834
My diamond armor!

1136
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:10,375
Egg attack!

1137
01:22:11,667 --> 01:22:12,459
Friends!

1138
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,250
What is this, breakfast?

1139
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,042
Get off of me!

1140
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,000
Hurry! The orb's up there!

1141
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:37,875
Do it, Henry!

1142
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,375
I got this!

1143
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,792
Go, Henry, go!

1144
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,834
Hey, Captain Buttcrack!

1145
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,890
I got something for you!

1146
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,459
Get him, Dennis!

1147
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,500
Take a bite out of that pig!

1148
01:23:29,709 --> 01:23:31,125
Finish this, Henry!

1149
01:23:55,584 --> 01:23:56,667
Henry!

1150
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:02,959
No!

1151
01:24:13,459 --> 01:24:14,500
I got you, buddy!

1152
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:16,834
Yeah!

1153
01:24:18,584 --> 01:24:19,500
Yes!

1154
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:22,084
Yes!

1155
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,292
Garrett, you're alive!

1156
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:24,459
Yeah!

1157
01:24:25,959 --> 01:24:28,292
Between us, I used
Steve's water bucket trick.

1158
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:29,584
Pretty cool, huh?

1159
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:30,917
Little bit.

1160
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:32,834
Let's get this orb and go home.

1161
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:39,947
All right, Hank. It's fireball time.

1162
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,334
Grab that spear.

1163
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,625
I want you to jab it in the tentacles.

1164
01:24:45,709 --> 01:24:46,875
Woohoo, jab it!

1165
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,834
Yeah!

1166
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:52,500
How'd you learn how to do that?

1167
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:53,625
Don't ask.

1168
01:25:18,084 --> 01:25:19,238
No!

1169
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:21,417
What have you done?

1170
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,750
The orb!

1171
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,834
Yes! Go, Henry!

1172
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:01,941
Come on!

1173
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,584
It's good to see you, Garbage Man!
-Yeah, dude!

1174
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:20,084
You failed, witch.

1175
01:26:20,834 --> 01:26:22,500
The Overworld lives on.

1176
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,459
You too have fallen for the great lie.

1177
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:27,584
You'll never be happy.

1178
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:29,750
Deep down, you know,

1179
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:33,042
to hope, to dream, to create,

1180
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:34,209
is to suffer.

1181
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:35,167
You're right.

1182
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,375
It is harder to create than to destroy.

1183
01:26:39,209 --> 01:26:42,334
That's why cowards
tend to choose the deuce.

1184
01:26:43,917 --> 01:26:44,917
Later, Gosh.

1185
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:49,667
Every minute knowing you has been
a horror show waste of time.

1186
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,625
Wait, one more thing.

1187
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,500
Come closer.

1188
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:57,750
Do you have a little knife that
you're going to try to stab me with?

1189
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:59,834
No, no, I'm too weak.

1190
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:02,500
Alright.

1191
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:05,959
Come on!

1192
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:07,459
It was worth a shot.

1193
01:27:07,709 --> 01:27:09,584
Wait, wait, let me say one more thing.

1194
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,417
Come closer.
-No way!

1195
01:27:11,584 --> 01:27:13,167
No, really, it's about you.

1196
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:15,625
Fine.

1197
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:19,625
Lean down here.

1198
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,167
You really are the worst.

1199
01:27:25,459 --> 01:27:26,250
Goodbye.

1200
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:28,500
This is it, really! Come back!

1201
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,084
I don't even have a knife.

1202
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:31,584
Where would I keep it?

1203
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:34,625
Sneak attack!

1204
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:46,000
Hey!

1205
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,667
Sure you want to go back, Henry?

1206
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:51,000
It won't feel like this.

1207
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,959
There you got constraints,

1208
01:27:54,584 --> 01:27:55,667
and judgments,

1209
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,459
obstacles.

1210
01:27:57,792 --> 01:27:58,459
Yeah, I know.

1211
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,500
But I'm going to go make stuff anyway.

1212
01:28:04,084 --> 01:28:04,917
I like that.

1213
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:07,917
You're a brave kid.

1214
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:09,959
Steve,

1215
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,084
you still cool with this?

1216
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:16,542
Yeah.

1217
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:17,750
Come here, boy.

1218
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:19,375
Yeah.

1219
01:28:21,084 --> 01:28:22,572
Of course I still love you.

1220
01:28:23,042 --> 01:28:24,792
That's why I think this is a good idea.

1221
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:27,250
You changed my life.

1222
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:30,750
It's time for you to go change hers too.

1223
01:28:32,584 --> 01:28:35,417
<i>Go now, Dennis</i>

1224
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:39,459
<i>Change Dawn's life, Dennis</i>

1225
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:42,042
<i>Go on a journey</i>

1226
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:44,667
<i>And think of me</i>

1227
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:46,667
<i>Dennis</i>

1228
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:52,042
<i>Go now, legendary wolf of my dreams</i>

1229
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,292
<i>My doggie, doggie, doggie</i>

1230
01:28:56,834 --> 01:28:58,500
<i>My Dennis</i>

1231
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,292
If I would have known
you could sing like that,

1232
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,334
it would have helped me get past your smell.

1233
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:16,542
Garrett,

1234
01:29:18,084 --> 01:29:19,959
you are a truly bodacious warrior

1235
01:29:21,042 --> 01:29:22,334
and a really good friend.

1236
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:25,209
I wish you'd come home with us.

1237
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:27,959
Hank's cool,

1238
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,917
but I don't have any friends my age.

1239
01:29:38,209 --> 01:29:39,834
We would make a great team.

1240
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:43,667
Vio con dios.

1241
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:46,334
It means "goodbye", brother.

1242
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:48,125
No, it doesn't.

1243
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:51,405
Don't look at her. It does.

1244
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:52,917
No, it does not.

1245
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:54,584
Yeah it does.

1246
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:58,709
Love you guys!

1247
01:29:59,584 --> 01:30:01,072
Are you sure you don't want to come back?

1248
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,875
Yeah, I'm staying here. I got
a bunch more stuff I want to build.

1249
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,500
Why don't you bring some
of that magic to the real world?

1250
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:31,167
Screw it.

1251
01:30:31,584 --> 01:30:32,417
I'm coming with.

1252
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:39,709
Turns out the Overworld taught us
you can create the life you dream of.

1253
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:42,167
Even in the real world.

1254
01:30:42,709 --> 01:30:45,250
Garrett's store became
the hottest place in town.

1255
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:47,125
And the best part?

1256
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:49,292
His new friends were never far.

1257
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:53,780
So with Henry and Natalie's help,
we created the hit game

1258
01:30:53,959 --> 01:30:56,042
Block City Battle Buddies.

1259
01:30:57,375 --> 01:31:00,584
All that time in the Overworld
upped everyone's game.

1260
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,375
And every Friday,

1261
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:05,459
I would let it rip!

1262
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:09,375
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1263
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,250
<i>I used to wake up and play
back in my childhood days</i>

1264
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:17,250
<i>Getting old is such a dirty shame</i>

1265
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,866
<i>They never gave me a chance
to let my imagination dance</i>

1266
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,709
<i>Till I came up with a different game</i>

1267
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:29,667
<i>Down in the mines, all of the time
Craftin'</i>

1268
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:33,500
<i>Out in the sun, having some fun
Laughin'</i>

1269
01:31:33,542 --> 01:31:37,167
<i>I'm never ever looking back 'cause</i>

1270
01:31:37,209 --> 01:31:40,280
<i>I feel alive</i>

1271
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:41,209
<i>Yeah</i>

1272
01:31:42,459 --> 01:31:45,110
Dawn finally got to ditch
her real estate job.

1273
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,542
She and Dennis brought
the party wherever they went.

1274
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:53,334
Natalie decided to share
her new skill set with the real world.

1275
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:55,625
Survival Mode Self-Defense.

1276
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:02,655
The streets of Chuglass
have never been safer.

1277
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,167
You get 'em, Natalie!

1278
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:06,375
And Henry?

1279
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:09,375
He finally got that jetpack to work.

1280
01:32:14,584 --> 01:32:17,292
<i>I feel alive</i>

1281
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:21,209
<i>I move mountains with my mind</i>

1282
01:32:21,959 --> 01:32:25,000
<i>I feel the high</i>

1283
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:28,959
<i>Like a new moon on the rise</i>

1284
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:32,375
<i>I feel alive</i>

1285
01:32:32,584 --> 01:32:36,167
<i>Like a redstone overdrive</i>

1286
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:39,834
<i>I feel the high</i>

1287
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:43,500
<i>With the power of the wolf inside</i>

1288
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:47,667
<i>I feel alive</i>

1289
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:48,375
<i>Yeah</i>

1290
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:05,959
I know how much you love bread.

1291
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:09,834
Marlene, your ex-husband's here.

1292
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:11,125
He said it was an emergency.

1293
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:15,042
Well, you tell him
I've got nothing to say to him.

1294
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:18,209
You gotta be kidding me,
Marlene. This is the guy?

1295
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:19,875
Too late, Clemente.

1296
01:33:20,334 --> 01:33:21,570
You had your chance.

1297
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:24,655
She's right, Clemente.
You totally blew it.

1298
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:28,822
And now I reap the rewards of your mistake.

1299
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:33,155
You see, when Marlene's
Jeep Grand Cherokee ran me over,

1300
01:33:33,459 --> 01:33:35,792
I was struck by a love so powerful

1301
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:39,625
it transcended the barriers
of conventional speech.

1302
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,500
Now I speak human
and she speaks villager.

1303
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,000
Marlene, ever since we met last night,

1304
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:55,709
I wanted to say:

1305
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:57,250
Would you marry me?

1306
01:33:57,917 --> 01:34:00,125
Yes! Yes!

1307
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,292
A thousand times yes!
